<p>Some resources include a <em>links</em> property, which contains pointers to its various subresources (so an <strong>Artist</strong> has an <strong>Events</strong> subresource, among others). Some of these subresources are <strong>embeddable</strong>, which means that you can include them in the response when requesting the main resource. These are annotated throughout the documentation as <strong>embeddable</strong> resources.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p><code>
https://bifrost.clubjudge.com/v1/artists/1981.json?embeds=events
</code></p>

<p>This yields:</p>

<p><code>
{
  "artist": {
    "id": 1981,
    "name": "Tiesto",
    ...
    "events": {
      "_pagination": {
        "currentPage": 1,
        "perPage": 10,
        "totalPages": 3,
        "totalItems": 22
      },
      "_links": {
        "first": "https://bifrost.clubjudge.com/v1/artists/1981/events.json?page=1",
        "previous": null,
        "self": "https://bifrost.clubjudge.com/v1/artists/1981/events.json?page=1",
        "next": "https://bifrost.clubjudge.com/v1/artists/1981/events.json?page=2",
        "last": "https://bifrost.clubjudge.com/v1/artists/1981/events.json?page=3"
      },
      "source": [...]
    }
  }
}
</code></p>

<p>When embedding a subresource, its assorted metadata (such as <em>_links</em> and <em>_pagination</em>) will be under a key with the subresources name (<strong>events</strong> in this case). The actual response will be under a special <strong>source</strong> attribute (in this case, it contains an array of <a href="#/event-model">Events</a>).</p>
